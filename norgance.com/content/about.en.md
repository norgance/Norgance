Norgance is an online digital nation without any landmark. It is developed for everyone in the world, whoever and wherever they are.

The goal is to provide a few online services that nations usually provide, such as weddings and divorces or family register, while adhering to the universal declaration of human rights and respecting citizen privacy.

As an example, two spouses who may or may not have the same gender can register their marriage in the Norgance records, and obtain a receipt for themselves and the people they trust. Using secure cryptography algorithms, neither Norgance nor anyone else can know about it. Unless the spouses tell them of course. 

#### Why a new nation?

The main developer of Norgance had to register the citizenships of his child with two nationalities. The procedure was slightly cumbersome and involving waiting for paper documents being sent by mail across the world and physically visiting various administrative offices. The main developer thought that something better and more modern could be done, and decided to create a new online digital nation during the few hours of spare time of the parental leave.
